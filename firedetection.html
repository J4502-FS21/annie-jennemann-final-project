  <h2> Fire lookouts vs. new technology for fire detection</h2>

  <p> The history of fire detection in Missouri has drastically changed over the years. Fire lookout towers, manned by people, were used from the 1940s to the 1960s. As the number of wildfires decreased and technology improved, fire lookouts stopped being used and newer technology came into play. As of 2020, 65 towers are currently still standing in Missouri, according to MissouriLife Magazine. </p>

  <h3> Fire lookouts and past methods </h3>

  <p>People who detected fires from lookout towers used a device called an Osborne Fire Finder to detect fires. The device is a circular shaped map with the location of the lookout tower being the center. The device is used to detect the azimuth, which is the angle between the object and a known reference point. Along with another lookout tower, the two would use the device to detect the precise location of a fire. Since it is up to the people manning the towers to detect fires, human error is always a possibility. When lookout towers phased out, scout planes were also used as a method for fire detection.</p>

  <h3> Newer technology </h3>

  <p>Present day, newer technology is used to detect wildfires in Missouri. Drone, satellites and sensors can monitor Missouri lands 24/7 for wildfire activity — instead of having people monitor. If a satellite picks up activity, it will send a message to whoever is in charge of monitoring, and then a person or a drone can be sent out to the site where the activity was detected. </p>
