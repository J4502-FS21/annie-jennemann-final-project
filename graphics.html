  <h2> Wildfire data in Missouri </h2>

      <p>This page is currently under construction. I am conducting a data analysis of wildfires in Missouri from 2002-2020 that includes location, cause of fire and the number of acres burned. I am also currently working on getting some statistics about controlled or prescribed burns in Missouri — which are actually extremely important to maintaining Missouri’s lands. Check back soon for some great data and graphics on this. </p>
