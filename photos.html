  <h2> Look at a lookout </h2>

  <div id="phototext">
  <p> The Runge Conservation Center, located in Jefferson City, Mo., is home to a 55-foot fire lookout tower.
    The tower was moved to Runge in 2000, but used to stand 77-feet tall at Rocky Mount.
    It was orginally built in 1949. For 31 years, the same man, P.A. Hess staffed the tower. </p>
